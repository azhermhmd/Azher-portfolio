# Power-of-Two Reorder Interval Optimization (MIT ESD.273J case)

**Source:** MIT OpenCourseWare (ESD.273J / 1.270J Logistics & Supply Chain Management)

**Objective:** Find effective reorder intervals for a warehouse and 24 retailers for a single high-volume product.
The original problem requires computing reorder intervals, total cost, and showing the solution's proximity to optimal.

## What I did (professional summary)
1. Reconstructed the dataset from the MIT problem statement and saved it as `mit_power_of_two_dataset.csv`.
2. Computed continuous EOQ (economic order quantity) solutions for each retailer:
   - EOQ `Q = sqrt(2*D*S / H)`
   - Cycle time `T = Q / D`
3. Implemented a **power-of-two rounding policy** using a weekly base period `base = 1/52 year`. Candidate periods = base * 2^k.
4. Rounded each retailer's EOQ cycle to the nearest power-of-two period and computed the implied order quantity.
5. Approximated warehouse ordering and holding costs by assuming the warehouse places an order whenever a retailer is replenished (this is a simplifying assumption).
6. Calculated total annual cost under continuous EOQ and under the power-of-two policy and reported the percentage difference.

## Key parameters used
- alpha (transport $/mile): 0.32  
- fixed shipping cost per retailer delivery C: $150  
- warehouse order fixed cost S0: $400  
- base period for power-of-two: 1 week (1/52 year)

## Results (summary)
- Total annual cost (continuous EOQ, retailers + warehouse): see output of `analysis.py`
- Total annual cost (power-of-two rounding): see output of `analysis.py`
- Power-of-two policy cost should be within a few percent of continuous EOQ under these assumptions.

## Next steps / Improvements
- Exact combinatorial optimization to choose power-of-two periods jointly (search / IP) to guarantee within X% of optimal.
- Improved warehouse aggregation policy (combine retailer requisitions to reduce S0).
- Jupyter notebook version with narrative cells for GitHub preview.
- PDF project report for inclusion in applications.
